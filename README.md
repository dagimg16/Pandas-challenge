# PyCitySchools
This repository contains the solution to the PyCitySchools project, which is part of the Data Science boot camp. 
The project involves analyzing a dataset about a school district using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is 
to perform various analyses and create a report summarizing key metrics about the schools and students.

## Project Overview
The analysis in this repository includes the following key components:
**District Summary:**
  -  Total number of unique schools
  - Total number of students
  - Total budget
  - Average math and reading scores
  - Percentage of students passing math and reading
  - Overall passing percentage (students passing both math and reading)   
**School Summary:**
  - Key metrics for each school, including:
  - School name and type
  - Total number of students
  - Total school budget and per-student budget
  - Average math and reading scores
  - Percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects  
**Highest and Lowest-Performing Schools:**
  - Top and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing percentage  
**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**
  - Average math and reading scores by grade level for each school  
**Scores by School Spending:**
  - Breakdown of school performance based on spending per student, categorized into four spending bins
